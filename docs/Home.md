## Guidelines

### PHPStorm

- This repository is mad to work with PHPStorm
- No other IDE is supported or will be supported

### Git

- Git ignore root file, [ignore none sharable PHPStorm files](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544839)
- Larges files have to be pushed to the Github LFS

### NMV

- You have to use NVM to use the project NodeJS required version.

```shell
nvm use
```

### Javascript linter

- Default eslint configuration is based in `.eslintrc.json` at project root.
- All projects have to base it configuration on that configuration.
